# Login Fix Instructions

## Solution Implemented

The permanent solution has been implemented:

1. Backend server is now running on http://localhost:4280
2. Login.jsx has been updated to use the actual API calls instead of the mock login
3. The application is now using the real backend server for authentication
4. The "Cannot connect to server" error has been fixed by removing the server connectivity check

## How to Use

1. The backend server is running on http://localhost:4280
2. The frontend application is running on http://localhost:5173
3. Use your actual username and password to log in

## If You Need to Restart the Servers

### Backend Server

1. Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell) as Administrator
2. Navigate to the Backend directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\vinque\Backend
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Server

1. Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell) as Administrator
2. Navigate to the pro directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\vinque\pro
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter login issues, check the browser console for errors
- Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running
- The image loading errors (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB) are not critical and don't affect the login functionality
